/**
 * Presentation model for the sidebar's "opened by" tree.
 *
 * `SessionMeta.openedBySessionId` records the Session that CREATED another
 * Session — today that is `lody session create` running with a current session
 * in scope, which is how the `lody_session_create` MCP tool spawns independent
 * work. It is deliberately NOT `parentSessionId`:
 *
 * - `parentSessionId` is a semantic child (child tab / side chat). Those share
 *   the parent's workspace, are filtered out of the sidebar entirely
 *   (`sessionListAtom`), and roll their activity up into the parent row.
 * - `openedBySessionId` is a presentation-only provenance link. The opened
 *   Session keeps its own work context, machine, project, and lifecycle; it is
 *   a first-class sidebar row that merely renders INDENTED under its opener so
 *   the fan-out is legible.
 *
 * The two must not be conflated: a Session carrying both is already excluded
 * from the sidebar by `parentSessionId`, so it can never be nested twice.
 *
 * Rules encoded here (the narrowest ones the current data supports):
 *
 * 1. A row nests only when its opener is VISIBLE in the same list. An opener
 *    that is archived, owned by another scope, sitting in a different repo
 *    group, or simply gone leaves the opened Session as a normal top-level row
 *    (the "orphan fallback"). Nothing is ever hidden by this model.
 * 2. Depth is capped at one. A grandchild (A opened B, B opened C) attaches to
 *    the topmost visible ancestor A, so the sidebar stays a dense two-level
 *    tree rather than an unbounded outline.
 * 3. Cycles and self-references degrade to top-level rows. Every input item
 *    appears exactly once in the output, in a deterministic order.
 * 4. Roots keep their incoming order (the caller has already sorted by pinned /
 *    latest activity); nested rows keep their incoming order under their opener.
